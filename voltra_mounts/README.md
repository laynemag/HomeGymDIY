- [Reddit Discussion & Build Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/BeyondPower/comments/1nmpn8i/easy_diy_belt_squat_base/)

### 🔧 Specifications
- **Base Material:** 2x6 and 4x4 lumber
- **Mounting Plate:** SendCutSend steel plate
- **Finish:** Powder coat recommended (clear coat over polished steel rusts easily)

### 💡 Build Notes
> Created with a simple SendCutSend plate, 2x6, and 4x4s. The mount is rotated slightly so the pulley comes out more centered on the platform.

### 💭 Lessons Learned
- Add clearance on the floor side for VOLTRA screws
- Use powder coating instead of polished steel with clear coat (polishing is difficult and rust develops despite clear coat)
- No damage to floor mats reported
