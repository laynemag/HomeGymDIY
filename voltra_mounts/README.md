# [Tranman](tranman/)

## Low Profile Fixed Mount
I used M5 x 0.8 countersunk hex bolts to attach the plastic. Note that you can only mount the Voltra in one orientation with this mount due to the bolts getting in the way.

- SCS cost was $54.70 for two + shipping using Stainless Steel 304 series .187"
- Also will need the 3d printed shim, not sure on price
