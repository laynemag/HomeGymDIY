## Requests

Need a custom metal bracket, 3D printed accessory, or other part? You can submit a request even if you are brand new to GitHub:

1. [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one.
2. Click **Issues** ▸ **New issue** ▸ choose **Part Request**.
3. Fill in the short form (what the part does, material, dimensions, mounting hardware, reference links/photos, and how to contact you). Drag-and-drop images or sketches directly into the issue.
4. Submit the issue. You can edit it later if you remember more details.

Every request automatically gets a `request` label so we can track it. We will reply on the issue if we need clarification or to share progress.

## Project Organziation

Folders will be organized into general more generalized parts, and will have their own README.md files with specific details.

## Getting Your Custom Stuff Made

The most common service used has been Send Cut Send, however Oshcut and many others might be cheaper or offer more specialized services like bending close to holes, etc.
