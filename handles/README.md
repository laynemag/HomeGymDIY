![Forza Upgrade Handles](mech6/forza-upgrade-parts.jpg)

### 📁 Files

- [Larger STEP](mech6/larger-forza-version.STEP)
- [Smaller STEP](mech6/smaller-forza-version.STEP)

### 🔧 Specifications

- Designed for laser cutting from 0.187"–0.250" steel or stainless; confirm exact thickness from the STEP before ordering
- Add tumble/deburr plus powder coat or Cerakote for grip comfort
- Tapping/hardware requirements are called out in the CAD; size holes to match your preferred swivel hooks or carabiners
- Recommend using PETG for 3D printing, **Need 4 total printed, two each handle**

### 📝 Notes

- Two STEP files mirror each other so you can build left/right handles
- Consider pairing with Prime-style rubber grips or powder-coated steel tubes for the palm surface
- If cutting through SendCutSend, include bend/tap services only if you update the STEP to match their specs; current files are flat patterns
