## Trak Kaz Knurled Handle (sinix)

Knurled handles designed for cable machine attachments with ergonomic grip. Would recommend printing in TPU to keep the rubber feel, however PETG/PLA will work too.

## VTS Custom Rotating Handles (spohc)

![vts-rep-handle](spohc/VTS-rep-trap-handles.png)

### 📁 Files

- No special files needed as these are built with off-the-shelf parts.

### 📝 Description

These custom rotating handles are built using parts from Rep Fitness Open Trap Bar handles and other standard gym hardware. The concept relies on the fact that many knurled handles (Rorman Strength Megalith, Rep Fitness Open Trap Bar, WM Fabs Mo Row, Giant Lifting) use the same M10-1.5 bolt size and thread pitch.

### 🛒 Parts & Supplies

#### Handles & Brackets

- [Rep Fitness Open Trap Bar Handles](https://repfitness.com/products/open-trap-bar-handles?variant=42225145643166)
  - *Note:* Be careful when removing the bolts as they can strip easily. This set provides 3 pairs of handles to tinker with. The center bracket is the key component.

#### Mounting Hardware

- **Band Pegs:** 1" band peg required.
  - [Rogue Monster Band Pegs 2.0](https://www.roguefitness.com/monster-band-pegs-2-0-4-pack) (Recommended for flush fit)
  - Oak Club band pegs also work.
  - *Alternative:* [Amazon Band Pegs](https://a.co/d/iRFunIt) (Check dimensions)
- **Collars:** Standard size weight collar to fasten the bracket.
  - [Example Collar](https://a.co/d/ddiLgF9)
- **Rotation:** Needle bearing washers are needed if you want the handles to rotate smoothly.
  - [Needle Bearing Washers](https://a.co/d/1qIFRCS)

### 💡 Tips

- You can save money by buying one of the other trap bar handle variants if you don't need the thick grips.
- Fringe Sport used to sell cheaper band pegs, but availability varies.
- A long enough bolt or rod could also work in place of a band peg.

### 🔧 Materials & Specifications

- **Material:** 0.313" (5/16") Steel
